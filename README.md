# TrashMan (2019)

Description
===========
Let's you mark with a click all of those hundreds of useless items 
to sell all at once the next time you visit the appropriate merchant.  
Provides a UI so that you can select which tiers of items to sell.  
Items already favorited will not get marked for sale.

Installation
============
Extract the zip file to your Avorion directory.  
No files will be overwritten unless you already have this script installed.  
Option A: Use the ShipScriptLoader at http://www.avorion.net/forum/index.php/topic,3918.0.html  
Option B: Hit enter and paste this into your chat window  
/run Entity():addScript("../../mods/TrashMan/scripts/TrashMan.lua")  
(With option B, you will have to do that once each time you create a new ship.)  
If you're playing on a dedicated server, the server also must have this mod installed.
